# QSAR-study

## Project Title: 
### Comparison of machine learning models for predicting PPARs activators

## Research Objectives:
We aimed to utilise multiple machine learning models to predict the biological activities of compounds for the target protein (PPAR alpha).

## Research Methodology:
1.	Data was collected from the ChEMBL database.
2.	Molecular descriptors were calculated using Morgan descriptor.
3.	Machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, HistGradientBoosting, KNeighbors, Multi-layer Perceptron, Support Vector and voting regression.
4.	QSAR models: a mathematical model utilised for quantitative mapping and predicting the biological properties of compounds based on their chemical structure knowledge.
